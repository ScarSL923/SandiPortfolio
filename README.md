### Power Apps Project Example 1
Recipe Repository with Approval Process - Power App
Power App designed to serve as a comprehensive recipe repository with an integrated approval process. This application allows users to submit their own recipes, which are then reviewed and approved by designated approvers and viewable in the recipe gallery. 

Key features include:
- User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design for easy recipe submission and browsing.
- Approval Workflow: Automated process for reviewing and approving submitted recipes.
- Search and Filter: Advanced search and filtering options to quickly find specific recipes.
- Notifications: Real-time notifications to keep users informed about the status of their submissions.
- Data Management: Secure storage and management of recipe data.
  
This project showcases my skills in app development, workflow automation, and user experience design.
